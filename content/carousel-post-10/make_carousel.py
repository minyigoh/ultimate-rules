# ImageMagick 6 lowers each <text> element into an MVG `text x,y "..."`
# primitive whose payload is itself double-quoted, so a double-quote that lands
# against either delimiter is silently dropped. Quotes in the middle survive.
# The <tspan> gives the reader a child element to lower instead, so the quote
# is no longer adjacent to a delimiter and renders.
#
# The leading half of this came from reel-21, which shipped `Violation" is a
# legal` with the opening quote missing (Min-Yi, 2026-08-24). **The trailing
# half is new, found here on 2026-09-02** while proofing this deck: slide 3's
# takeaway wrapped so its last line was `hand."` and the closing quote vanished
# from the PNG while sitting correctly in the SVG. Measured on all four cases:
#
#   bare `hand."`            -> trailing quote dropped
#   bare `"Contest" x`       -> leading quote dropped   (the known reel-21 case)
#   bare `"a b."`            -> BOTH dropped
#   bare `say "hi" now`      -> fine
#   the same three in <tspan> -> all quotes survive
#
# So the condition is startswith OR endswith, not startswith alone.
# content/reel-*/render_v3.py still carry the startswith-only version and want
# the same edit; see the note in this deck's caption.md.
