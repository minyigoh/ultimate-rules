# ImageMagick 6 lowers each <text> element into an MVG `text x,y "..."`
# primitive whose payload is itself double-quoted, so a double-quote that lands
# against either delimiter is silently dropped. Quotes in the middle survive.
# The <tspan> gives the reader a child element to lower instead, so the quote
# is no longer adjacent to a delimiter and renders.
#
# The leading half of this came from reel-21, which shipped `Violation" is a
# legal` with the opening quote missing (Min-Yi, 2026-08-24). **The trailing
# half is new, found here on 2026-09-02** while proofing this deck: slide 3's
# takeaway wrapped so its last line was `hand."` and the closing quote vanished
# from the PNG while sitting correctly in the SVG. Measured on all four cases:
#
#   bare `hand."`            -> trailing quote dropped
#   bare `"Contest" x`       -> leading quote dropped   (the known reel-21 case)
#   bare `"a b."`            -> BOTH dropped
#   bare `say "hi" now`      -> fine
#   the same three in <tspan> -> all quotes survive
#
# So the condition is startswith OR endswith, not startswith alone.
# content/reel-*/render_v3.py still carry the startswith-only version and want
# the same edit; see the note in this deck's caption.md.

# "It shouldn't just cover 5 lessons. It should cover 7 lessons from Thursday
# all the way to Wednesday - Reel 29 to 35." Reel 29 posted Thursday
# 2026-09-03 and reel 35 posts Wednesday 2026-09-09, the day before this deck.
# v1 of this script ran 28-32 on the strict has-it-posted-yet reading.
#
# NOTE: lesson 28 ("Receiving fouls") now falls in the seam between
# carousel-post-5's block (22-27) and this one, and is un-recapped. Flagged in
# script-feedback.md and in the run report; the suggestion on the table is
# that carousel-post-7 opens with it.
#
# Takeaways are each lesson's `field` line, verbatim -- lessons-2.json for
# 29-34, lessons-3.json for 35. Footers carry that lesson's `rules` array
# unchanged. Recap slides cite rule numbers only, never rule text, by design
# (see content/CAROUSEL_TEMPLATE.md).
